changes:
  - admin: welding/unwelding an airlock will be logged

      for better readability
  - code_imp: timers are put in the closest future bucket, as a precaution
  - tweak: medibots have more skins based on which first aid kit was used when it's
      made. These currently have no speicla ability by its shape which means these
      are just skins.

  - tweak: The phobias of Robots and Doctors are slightly less likely to occur
  - tweak: The phobia of Space is significantly less likely to occur
  - rscadd: Lizard speech now has a variation on the use of X in normal conversation.
      Things like "Xenomorph" will sound the same as before as it is phonetically

  - bugfix: Tying and untying bandanas will give the proper notice to people seeing
      it
  - balance: Decreased the snowball effect of fear build-up from (stress x10)% to
      (stress x5)%. Your stress levels build up faster with each fainting now, which
      leads to a higher chance of a heartattack
  - bugfix: You wont faint immediately after waking up from a faint caused by a phobia
  - bugfix: The message for fainting from a phobia will actually be visible for the
      one fainting now
  - rscadd: Added a small bit of text indicating AIs should Ahelp before using the
      "Wipe-Core" verb
