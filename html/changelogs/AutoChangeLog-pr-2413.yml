changes:
  - rscdel: Removed the Surgery Drapes from the Debug Omnitool.
  - code_imp: Converts the act of initiating or cancelling surgeries into a component,
      this allows for any item to support surgeries.
  - refactor: Replaced the old surgery interface with one that is much better to use,
      and lets you choose the body zone within itself.
