changes:
  - refactor: Refactored the "pilot" "gunner" etc strings to use bitflags
  - code_imp: Removed incapacitation check for fighter pilot at the hardpoint level
      since interceptClickOn already checks if the user is incapacitated
  - code_imp: Pilot-only weapons no longer have to be added to the interceptClickOn
      proc by hand
