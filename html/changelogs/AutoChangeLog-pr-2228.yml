changes:
  - refactor: Refactors how targeting is handled
  - rscadd: DRADIS now has a targeting mode, cycled using the hailing/targeting button.
      Clicking on enemies in targeting mode will paint them, and clicking on friendlies
      will pass your current target lock to them via datalink
  - tweak: Tweaks how datalink functions. It is no longer automatic, and the sending
      ship must maintain a lock to maintain the datalink transmission. Targets recieved
      via datalink are also visible on DRADIS now.
  - tweak: Painted targets will now be lost if radar contact is not maintained.
  - rscadd: Readds the gunner's optical camera. This works on large ships and some
      small ships with TAC consoles, and has a range similar to that of the ship's
      base sensor range.
  - balance: AI ships will now target incoming ordnance with PDCs, and will target
      ships locking them with flak.
  - balance: All overmap ships are now limited to 3 target paints, except for fighters,
      which are limited to one paint. Fighters will also automatically lock onto the
      target they paint.
  - bugfix: Fixes some null handling issues in target lists.
  - code_imp: Homing is now based on the projectile being fired instead of the weapon.
  - tweak: Non-fighter ghost ships now have access to active radar.
