changes:
  - tweak: tweaked the taunt the Alicorn says when it enters the system
  - tweak: tweaked the naming routine of the Alicorn's fighter squadron to be shorter
      and have random numbers assigned.
  - tweak: the Alicorn will now use Battleship AI instead of destroyer, hopefully
      meaning it'll peruse it's target a bit more ruthlessly.
  - balance: rebalanced the special weapon and round of the Alicorn to hopefully be
      a bit easier to avoid.
  - bugfix: fixed the alicorn destroying smooth movement when it so much as dares
      to exist.
