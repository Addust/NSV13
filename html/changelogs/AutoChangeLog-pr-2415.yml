changes:
  - rscadd: Added a new UI thats being used to allow for an easier way of finding
      people on cameras for the AI
  - code_imp: Altered the Teleport to Area input proc to a tgui_input_list version
  - refactor: Changed it so you have an interface to click on names in order to find
      people who are on cameras whilst playing as the AI rather than having to scroll
      through a dull list.
