changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new cyborg module: Cargo Cyborgs! Paperwork experts and aces\
      \ at delivery, they'll truly complement the Silicon gameplay by finally allowing\
      \ you to scratch that forms-filling itch you had for so long!"
  - bugfix: Fixed cyborgs re-generating a bunch of icons every time they'd pick a
      model, with more optimizations to that to come.
  - rscadd: Cargo Borgs now come equip with a export scanner.
  - rscadd: Added a new cyborg upgrade to Engineering borgs which allows them to perform
      some munitions work!
  - refactor: refactored the borg icon stuff to allow for easier implementation of
      other skins for borg modules
  - balance: Cargoborgs upgraded clamp can now carry two wrapped crates instead of
      one.
