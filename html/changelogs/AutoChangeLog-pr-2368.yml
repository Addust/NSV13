changes:
  - rscadd: Re-added bulldog stun ammo, the mech taser, stun shells in the Electric
      weapons research, and electrodes as a possible ammo type for the nuclear gun
  - balance: Made slippery plants, wet floors, and bananium'd surfaces stun
  - balance: Made the ebow stun people but do less damage
  - balance: Borgs can spin-stun people
  - balance: Bananium, clownop sword and shield, soap, the clown's PDA, and banana
      peels have a minor chance to make you throw the things you're holding instead
      of just dropping them
  - balance: Buffed flashbangs
  - balance: Table-pushing someone briefly stuns them, does less stamina damage, and
      no longer does any brute damage. Slamming their head into a table still does
      normal damage.
  - balance: Reduced the energy cost of the HOS electrodes
  - balance: Made beanbag slugs stun briefly and rubbershot knock down.
  - balance: Police batons stun instead of dealing stamina damage.
  - tweak: Replaced the Aetherwhisp armory disablers with advanced tasers
