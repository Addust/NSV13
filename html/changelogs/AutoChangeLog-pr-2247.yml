changes:
  - bugfix: Tyrosene pumps no longer have infinite range.
  - bugfix: Tyrosene pumps will now continue pumping until they're completely out
      of fuel, instead of pumping until they have less than 50 units of fuel.
  - tweak: Small craft fueling now respects delta_time. As a side effect of this it's
      now also twice as fast.
